## Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Time to HIV Viral Suppression in the U.S. Deep South

###  Tract C68: Effects of the COVID-19 on HIV epidemiology and prevention

Additional Figures and Tables for Presentation

### Background: Between 2012 and 2018, states in the United States (US) Deep South, the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic, achieved year-over-year reductions in time to viral suppression (VS) following HIV diagnosis, critical to improving outcomes and reducing transmission. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted HIV services and may have reduced previous gains.

### Methods: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all persons â‰¥ 13 years with newly diagnosed HIV from 2018-2020 in Alabama (AL), Louisiana (LA), and Mississippi (MS), using data collected in the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS), a standardized HIV surveillance system maintained in each state. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to describe time in days to VS by year of diagnosis. The Kaplan-Meier Method was used to describe time to viral suppression by year of diagnosis. The results of this analysis are detailed in: Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2a-c. Additionally, we used meta-analysis across the state specific Cox Proportional Hazards model to examine associations with age, race/ethnicity, gender at birth, mode of HIV transmission, and AIDS Stage at diagnosis (Stage 3 vs other). The results of this analysis are detailed in: Table 2 and Figure 3.

### Results: In AL (N=570) and LA (N=703), median time to VS in 2020 increased 21 and 16 days, respectively, while MS (N=412) improved by 4 days compared to 2019, reversing prior trends in rates of improvement from 2018 (Figure 1). Compared with 2019, there was an increase in proportion of new HIV diagnosis with Stage 3 presentations in AL (23.7% vs 22.3%) and LA (23.3% vs 22.3%), and a higher proportion of missing data in HIV method of transmission in all 3 states (AL=70.9% vs 46.5%, MS= 46.4% vs 45.1%, LA=25.5% vs 17%) in 2020. The proportion achieving VS at 180 days also decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 (AL: 64.1% vs 64.9%, MS: 57.7% vs 59.1%, LA: 66.9% vs 68.3%).


### Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic within the HIV epidemic has complicated efforts in ending HIV in the US South. Prior to COVID-19, consistent improvements in median time to VS were seen in AL, LA, and MS. This positive trend has been stunted with HIV treatment and prevention impacts including later stage presentations and challenges to public health agencies' ability to collect information critical to informing targeted HIV prevention programming.
